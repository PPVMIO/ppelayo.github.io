	<center><h1>Power Rankings Week 12</h1></center>
	<center><h3>10. StO BBB Team</h3></center>
	<p>It seems Joshua Pelayo - a coach infamous for refusing to play Steph Curry and Ben Simmons - is finally starting to get his act together.  After facing fines and pressure from other league managers, StO BBB team is finally paying attention.  During a recent interview at a local basketball court, when asked about team negligence, Coach Pelayo responded, "YOU AINT A BIG BALLER," then proceeded to airball a three pointer.  Still - there is no denying that talent exists on this team and while the odds of making the playoffs are now slim, it's possible that this team could play spoiler to teams looking to make a playoff run.</p>

	<center><h3>9. King Kuzma</h3></center>
	<p>Coach Jeffrey Kang is a diehard lakers fan but it looks like his team might actually be as bad as the lakers. King Kuzma has now lost the last 6 games (his last win coming against StO BBB team back when LiAngelo ball was still on the UCLA team).  There's not much to say about this team.  I wouldn't be surprised to see King Kuzma at the bottom of the league when the season's over.</p>

	<center><h3>8. JWang's Primo Team</h3></center>
	<p>With 2 wins in the last 3 weeks, it seems JWang's Primo Team might have finally figured something out (wow setting lineups wins you games).  This team, anchored by Kyrie Irving, is finally getting some serious help from a red hot Bradley Beal and although Kawhi is yet to return to his former self, it's no doubt only a matter of time until this team starts to do some damage to other teams.

	<center><h3>7. Gimmie my $120</h3></center>
	<p>Gimmie my $120? lol not at this rate.  After putting up the 3rd fewest points last week (JWang's Primo Team would have beaten this team) - Coach Maher is definitely feeling the burden of injuries.  Harden, Griffin, Hardaway, Parker, Lavine - those are all players that have either struggled to remain healthy or have not even seen minutes yet this year.  Can Maher keep himself in the playoff race long enough until his players return?  A comletely healthy Gimme my $120 team could be a force to be reckoned with later on.</p>

	<center><h3>6. Techincally 3rd</h3></center>
	<p>In what was the biggest upset of last week with a win over the Chicago Chingeros (or perhaps not an upset depending on who you ask) Matt McCrea and his newly named Technically 3rd team is looking SCARY.  We've been hearing it all season "there's too much talent on that team, they'll figure it out" and with a midseason acquisition of Oladipo, it seems this team is definitely starting to figure it out.  The team has put up the third most points in the league but has been poor definsively all season giving up the 3rd most points against.  Up this week is rival team Paul Ball.  A win this week would make Technically 3rd look like a dark horse title contender.</p>

	<center><h3>5. Eskettit</h3></center>
	<p>Who is the mysterious coach behind this team and what the fuck is an Eskettit??? While the team has gone a little under the radar Eskettit has quietely racked quite a few points and quality wins.  After a narrow loss to league leading Gucci Gucci, Eskettit now has the 6th most points in the league and could emerge as a strong playoff contender if they can secure the win over Chicago Chingero.</p>

	<center><h3>4. Paul Ball</h3></center>
	<p>Despite a rough loss two weeks ago, Paul Ball has bounced back with a solid win this past week against sibling coach Joshua Pelayo.  The Paull Ball roster is not a flashy one (seriously, who drafts Vucevic, Lopez, and Dragic) but they get the job done.  There is certainly enough talent on the team to make a solid playoff run but we're still questioning why it took him so long to drop Nwaba...and isn't KCP in jail or something?

	<center><h3>3. Chicago Chingero</h3></center>
	<p>Despite being the biggest consistent complaints about how the "the modern game just favors scorers" and "this scoring setting makes no sense," Jordan Wang and the Chicago Chingero's find themselves in third place after a tough loss to Technically 3rd.  If this ranking had come out two weeks ago, the Chingeros would have found themselves second in our rankings.  Don't be fooled, with Lonzo's return and Durant's impending comeback, this team is a legitamite title threat.</p>

	<center><h3>2. Big Baller Club</h3></center>
	<p>What does this team and Bitcoin have in problem? OVERRATTED (*clap* *clap* *clap* *clap* *clap*).  Well...maybe...The Big Baller Club is certainly putting up Big Baller numbers and they do hold the second spot in league standings buuuuttttt they have certainly benefited from the second fewest points against.  This coupled with their coach's questionable decision to trade Oladipo makes everyone wonder if this team is the real deal or not.  That being said Marcus Fidel has his team putting up some solid points and the win last week over a good team edges him just slighly over the third place team.

	<center><h3>1. Gucci Gucci</h3></center>
	<p>The New England Patriots of the league...there I said it.  The resemblance is uncanny.  Once again the league is asking themselves how is this team so good?  Devin Bill Belichick Barreras has his team at the top of the standings with an 11-0 record, 3 games ahead of the second place team.  Despite drafting Dennis Smith Jr. in the sixth round (you could have had Oladipo or Ben Simmons) and despite continual allegations of trade scandals and collusion (recall the Deandre Jordan trade from two years ago, or the near Gortat mishap earlier this season) there's no doubt this is the best team in the league right now.</p>
