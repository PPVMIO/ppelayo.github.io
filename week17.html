	<center><h1>Power Rankings Week 17</h1></center>
	<center><h3>10. StO BBB Team</h3></center>
	<p>Another week another L. This team has no past, present, or future just like the Brooklyn nets without draft picks or the GOAT Jeremy Lin but this team doesn’t even deserve an NBA comparison. This team is quite a popular story but for all the wrong reasons just like the ball brothers in BC Vytautas. What did Steph curry and Ben Simmons do to end up in fantasy Guantanamo? Will Paul actually fine his brother for never setting his lineup except against Chicago Chinegro? Is there collusion happening between the siblings? There are many questions and absolutely  zero answers with this team. </p>

	<center><h3>9. JWang's Primo Team</h3></center>
	<p>There are the right pieces there for this team but they just can’t seem to ever piece it together. JWang’s primo team has been putting the scare on some top tier teams in the beginning of matchups before eventually fizzing out at the end. After a trade with Chicago chinegro for a scorching hot ricky rubio things seemed to be on the up and up but unfortunately it seems like this team is destined for a cold winter in the league basement.</p>

	<center><h3>8. King Kuzma</h3></center>
	<p>What is this team? King Kuzma is a team that needs to tank but put up a few wins in the early part of the season and now is stuck in no mans land. This team is a sad reminder of what happens when you draft too many bigs in this league. #FreeDirk</p>

	<center><h3>7. Paul Ball</h3></center>
	<p>WOOF. All bark and no bite for Paul Ball this past week. Playing against a depleted Chicago Chinegro team without Prozingod and Lonzo Ball, Paul Ball not only needed a win but was essentially guaranteed one….except not? After posting a poll in the Ball Fondlers facebook group chat essentially guaranteeing a win, it all went downhill for our esteemed commissioner. With the fewest total points in the top 7 teams Paul Ball is spiraling and needs to make some LeGM moves to get his swagger back.</p>

	<center><h3>6. Esketttit</h3></center>
	<p>Esketttit took an L equivalent to the pelicans losing cousins in week 16 but bounced back big time against StO BBB Team (lol). Fighting for his playoff life, Eskettit faces the hottest team in the league in Technically 2nd and essentially needs to win out or hope that Paul Ball tanks to find his way into the playoff picture. Either one is possible but as a betting man I’d have my money on Paul Ball blowing it ;)</p>

	<center><h3>5. Chicago Chingero</h3></center>
	<p>No Porzingod no problem. Chicago Chinegro has had his share of draft and trade failures (sigh Avery Bradley, Myles Turner and Kyrie) but his rag tag group of ballers helped carry his team to victory over the Soft Paul Ball. Are the Pacers a title threat? Eh. But will they make the playoffs this year? Most likely yes. With Lonzo Ball looking at a return soon this team may be able to make some noise and upset a team or 2 in the playoffs. (#Etwaanmooresux)</p>

	<center><h3>4. Technically 2nd</h3></center>
	<p>I cannot in good conscience move this team any further up the rankings as they are currently out of a playoff spot but the real question is for how long? After a (questionable) trade equivalent to the warriors signing KD, the league has been officially shook. This team is like the Amazon of fantasy basketball. A true disruptor. A freak. A powerhouse. No one wants to play this team in the playoffs. There have been talks of intentionally losing to change seeds just to avoid this team. BUT, they are still currently out of a playoff spot and just like the warriors in the offseason, this team has to perform/win out to have a chance at glory</p>

	<center><h3>3. Gimme my $120</h3></center>
	<p>This team is getting hot and exactly at the right time. With Zach Levine looking like the possible steal of the draft and James Harden solidifying his MVP candidancy in both fantasy and the real NBA this team has a real shot at the championship. However, losing against a depleted Gucci Gucci team is exactly the type of noob move that the thunder would make.</p>

	<center><h3>1. Gucci Gucci</h3></center>
	<p>Lots of change for this team. Losing Love and Demarcus Cousins is the classic late season fantasy meltdown that we have come to know from Devin but these loses dont really have an equivalent to any one team in the NBA. However with a solid W against the up and coming Gimme my 120, this team showed it’s still a well-oiled machine. With some savvy pickups Gucci Gucci is making moves to not only guarantee a bye in the first round but also and a prolonged playoff run. </p>
